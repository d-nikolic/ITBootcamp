This project is my final project from [ITBootcamp](https://itbootcamp.rs/) QA course.  
The task was to test everything that I consider important for the functioning of the [website](https://demoqa.com/) using automated testing framework and POM design pattern.  
By no means a complete project, as I plan to update it from time to time with new methods.

It is a Maven-built project done with the following tech stack:  
**_Java_** - JDK 11 version  
**_ChromeDriver_** - 102.0.5005.61 version  
**_Selenium_** - 4.1.4 version  
**_TestNg_** - 7.6.0 version  
**_Project Lombok_** library - 1.18.4 version
